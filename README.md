## M.Sc. Data Science Thesis
**Thesis Title**  
*Machine learning popular algorithms: In-depth analysis and hands-on implementation.*  
**Scope - Purpose**  
The scope of this repository is to present essential information related with the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning, and implement a Command Line Interface that offers 3 main functionalities, explained below.

The theoretical part of this thesis is presented in Chapters 2 and 3 of thesis_kougianos.pdf, while the practical one in Chapter 4. The 3 main functionalities that are currently supported by the CLI are:
 1. Executing an algorithm of your choice to a predefined dataset. Algorithm execution metrics along with other information (username, cpu info etc.) are then saved to a MongoDB cluster.
 2. Open a dataset of your choice and create excel files with basic and extended information regarding the dataset.
 3. Retrieve algorithm execution metrics from other users (including yourself) and save them to an excel file.
